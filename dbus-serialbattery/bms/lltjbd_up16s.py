# NOTES
# RS-485 support for UP series JBD BMS.
#
# Tested on JBD UP16S015 with firmware 10.2.1 and 12.1.7.
# Protocol reference: https://gist.github.com/PhracturedBlue/7ef619594eaa4c27f4ff068b461865b8
# UP series might be the only series that supports this protocol.
# In theory, this protocol might also work over Bluetooth. For that, code in lltjbd_ble.py might need to be reused with lltjbd_up16s.py, but currently this is
# not implemented.
